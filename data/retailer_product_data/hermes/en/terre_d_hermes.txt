THE CREATION
Terre d'Hermès tells the story of man's relationship with the earth, his humble and harmonious dialogue with nature and the elements.
In 2009, Jean-Claude Ellena infused Terre d'Hermès with a new density by creating Terre d'Hermès Parfum.

OLFACTORY NOTES
A warm, woody fragrance, Terre d'Hermès Parfum combines enveloping cedar and sparkling grapefruit with a radiant note of shiso.

THE OBJECT
At its base, the bottle rests on a more visible orange H – echoing the deeper color of the fragrance – which leaves its imprint on the earth. At the top, the light is reflected by the bottle's metal shoulders.

THE HERMÈS DETAIL
When held in the hand, the Terre d'Hermès Parfum bottle unveils its many details: the House's iconic Clou de Selle, the sliding cover used to release the spray, etc.
Created by designer Philippe Mouquet, it is inspired by a bottle in a travel vanity case that is conserved at the Emile Hermès museum.
