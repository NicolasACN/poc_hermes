CREATION
Jour d'Hermès is a timeless, feminine composition that was created in 2012 by perfumer Jean-Claude Ellena: "I wanted to express the essence of femininity through flowers, and flowers alone."

OLFACTORY NOTES
Jour d'Hermès eau de parfum is a floral fragrance. It evokes the sensuality of gardenia and the delicacy of sweet peas in a perfectly orchestrated harmony.

THE OBJECT
Created by designer Pierre Hardy, the bottle displays rounded, sensual curves. At the center, a radiant drop of perfume hangs suspended.

ETHICS
The bottle can be replenished using the 125 ml eau de parfum refill. A responsible gesture, integral to an object created to last.

THE HERMÈS DETAIL
An essential tool for the artisan's work, light is the primary material at Hermès. It energizes objects and brings them to life, while revealing the beauty of the world. It is this light that inspired Jour d'Hermès, the most vital of fragrances.
