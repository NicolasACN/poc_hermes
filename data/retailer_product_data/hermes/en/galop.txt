CREATION
Created by Hermès perfumer Christine Nagel in 2016, Galop d'Hermès is inspired by the equestrian universe and embodies freedom of movement: "At Hermès, I discovered the true femininity of leather. I composed Galop d'Hermès like a painting with two materials emblematic to Hermès and to perfumery: leather and rose."

OLFACTORY NOTES
A floral, leathery fragrance, Galop d'Hermès presents notes of opulent rose and supple leather along with elegant saffron.

THE OBJECT
Designed by Philippe Mouquet, the stirrup bottle offers a modern take on the House's history and equestrian tradition.

ETHICS
The bottle is replenished using a 125 ml refill equipped with a filler cap in the shape of a funnel that slots perfectly into the neck of the bottle. A responsible gesture, integral to an object created to last.

THE HERMÈS DETAIL
Initially created as a gift for the guests invited to the opening of the first Hermès store in New York on 1 August 1930, the object was subsequently carefully preserved in the Conservatoire des créations Hermès. It was redesigned to become the Galop d'Hermès stirrup bottle.
