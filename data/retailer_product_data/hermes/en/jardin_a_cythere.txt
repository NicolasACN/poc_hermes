CREATION
Created by Hermès' perfumer Christine Nagel, Un Jardin a Cythere eau de toilette is a surprising garden that is neither green nor floral, but... blond. It is the expression of an olfactory quest through Greece that leads to Kythira, a picturesque island that has inspired many artists.

OLFACTORY NOTES
A citrus and woody fragrance, Un Jardin a Cythere eau de toilette combines enveloping notes of grasses with the strength of olive wood and the tenderness of fresh pistachio.

THE OBJECT
Designed by Fred Rawyler, the bottle is inspired by the lines of the horse-drawn carriage lanterns of yesteryear. The luminous yellow glass echoes the sunny fragrance. On the box, artist Elias Kafouros sketches a colorful landscape of his homeland: golden grasses, green olive trees, fresh pink pistachios and in the background, the blue of the sea.

THE PARFUMS-JARDINS COLLECTION
The Parfums-Jardins collection brings together the soul of a place, the perfumer's inspiration and the annual theme selected by Hermès. An aromatic journey for every moment, satisfying every desire for freshness, reverie or escape.
