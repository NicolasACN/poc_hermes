THE CREATION
Created by Christine Nagel for the Hermès girls, Tutti Twilly d'Hermès eau de parfum is a tribute to their free spirit – a blend of daring and lightheartedness – and their multifaceted nature. Individuality is reflected in this fragrance.

OLFACTORY NOTES
A floral and fruity eau de parfum with a generous character crafted with gentle ginger blossom, mellow lychee, and enveloping musk notes.

BOTTLE
Designed by Florence Manlik, the lantern-shaped bottle has a square silhouette, adorned with an inverted lychee-red color graduation. With a final flourish, a hand-tied silk ribbon playfully embellishes the cap of each bottle designed by Carine Brancowitz. Each silk ribbon is unique. Its 30 ml format allows you to take the notes of Tutti Twilly with you while on the go to diffuse the sparkle of the Hermès girls anywhere and everywhere.

THE HERMÈS DETAIL
The Twilly d'Hermès family of perfumes evokes the Hermès silk métier on two fronts: it calls to mind the house's silk twill scarf as well as the Twilly, a small, joyful, colorful silk ribbon that can be worn in countless ways.
