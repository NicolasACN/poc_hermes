Hermès Calèche Soie de Parfum Eau de Parfum, a highly feminine fragrance in which the nobility of iris is underscored by generous sandalwood.

Written in 1961 by Guy Robert, Calèche was Hermès' first fragrance for women. A highly feminine, woody, chypre floral, its name refers to the horse-drawn carriages that are emblematic of the house. Calèche is a novel that dazzles with the beauty of its raw materials, from the joyfulness of citrus fruit to the modernity of aldehyde notes; from the floral heart embellished with ylang-ylang, rose and jasmine to the woody, chypre sillage underscored by the nobility of the iris.
