Hermès Voyage d'Hermès Pure Perfume, a lively, giving fragrance in which the freshness of juniper berries blends with the milky warmth of sandalwood and the sensuality of amber.

An invitation to discover, meet and share. Jean-Claude Ellena

A novel that feeds on the imagination, Voyage d’Hermès expresses the long-standing and unusual relationship between the house and travel. An interplay of paradoxes, complements and unexpected alliances support the premise of woody notes that are fresh yet musky, familiar yet surprising, hovering between impulsive and comforting, equally at ease with men as with women. Hermès designer Philippe Mouquet created a travel object bottle for Voyage d’Hermès, designed for journeys and symbolic of movement.
