"Eau d’orange verte is the scent of the Little Prince in all of us." – Jean-Claude Ellena.



The original cologne created by Françoise Caron in 1979, inspired by the smell of undergrowth moist with morning dew, this fragrance has become an emblem of Hermès, and stands out for its distinctive freshness. The fragrance is an explosion of citrus notes, with orange, playing the central role between zests and leaves, lemon, mandarin, mint, and blackcurrant bud. Eau d’orange verte reveals its complexity in a unique sillage comprising oak moss and patchouli. Eau d’orange verte concentrated eau de toilette: the sustained freshness of a sparkling orange with a woody signature.
