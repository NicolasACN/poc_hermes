Herm√®s Un Jardin sur le Nil, a garden full of life, generous and sparkling, where the scents of green mango, lotus blossom and rush blend with incense and sycamore wood.

A new and rather unusual concept of freshness; green and vegetal scents; the smell of water and sand. Jean-Claude Ellena

Un Jardin sur le Nil is an impressionistic stroll through the island-gardens on the Nile at Aswan, the starting point for a new olfactory adventure. Green mango, lotus, calamus and sycamore wood all lie at the heart of this refreshing ode.
