THE CREATION
Created by Hermès perfumer Christine Nagel, Tutti Twilly d'Hermès Eau de Parfum presents another facet of Twilly. It is a tribute to the free spirit, forged from audacity and lightness, of the Hermès girls and to their multi-faceted nature.

OLFACTORY NOTES
A floral composition, the Eau de Parfum expresses its plurality through gentle ginger blossom, mellow lychee and enveloping musk.

THE OBJECT
The iconic lantern bottle – now square – was designed by Florence Manlik. Illuminated by a sunny brightness, it is playfully enhanced by a unique, silk ribbon that is hand-tied around the radiant white cap.

THE HERMÈS DETAIL
The Twilly d'Hermès fragrance tribe makes twin references to Hermès' silk métier, evoking both the house's silk twill scarf and the twilly, a cheerful little ribbon that can be worn in a variety of ways.
