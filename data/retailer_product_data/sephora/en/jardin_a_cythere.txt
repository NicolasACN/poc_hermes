CREATION

Created by Hermès’ perfumer Christine Nagel, Le Jardin à Cythère eau de toilette is a surprising garden that its neither green nor floral, but... blond. It is the expression of an olfactory quest through Greece that leads to Kythira, an unspoiled island that has inspired many artists.


OLFACTORY NOTES

A citrus and woody fragrance, Un Jardin à Cythère eau de toilette combines enveloping notes of grasses with the strength of olive wood and the tenderness of fresh pistachio.


THE OBJECT

Designed by Fred Rawyler, the bottle is inspired by the lines of the horse-drawn carriage lanterns of yesteryear. The luminous graduated yellow glass echoes the sunny fragrance. On the box, artist Elias Kafouros sketches a colourful landscape of his homeland: golden grasses, green olive trees, fresh pink pistachios and, in the background, the blue of the sea.


THE PARFUMS-JARDINS COLLECTION

The Parfums-Jardins collection brings together the soul of a place, the inspiration of the perfumer and the theme chosen by Hermès each year to illuminate its creation. An olfactory stroll to share for every moment, to indulge every desire for freshness, reverie or escape.
