VOYAGE D’HERMÈS

“An invitation to discovery, encounter, and sharing.” – Jean-Claude Ellena.

Voyage d’Hermès is a tale nourished by imagination, expressing the profound and unique relationship the house has with travel. The fragrance plays on paradoxes, complements, and novel alliances, delivering a fresh, musky, familiar yet surprising woody scent, equally at ease with masculinity and femininity. Philippe Mouquet, a designer for Hermès, created the nomadic bottle-object for Voyage d’Hermès, designed for travel and a messenger of movement.

The eau de toilette is lively and reassuring, new and familiar, balancing brightness and softness.

EAU DES MERVEILLES

“The perfume of enchantment. A surprising and magical amber wood for women.” – Jean-Claude Ellena.

From surprise to magic and from magic to enchantment, Eau des Merveilles leads us by the nose on a cloud of fantasy. A multifaceted novel built on a woody amber accord that resonates from the top notes, this fragrance, created in 2004 by Ralph Schwieger and Nathalie Feisthauer, achieves the feat of a sparkling femininity without apparent flowers.

The eau de toilette is sparkling and warm.

TERRE D’HERMÈS

The vigor of citrus and peppers allied with the flint note mark the imprint of the earth.

Terre d'Hermès tells the story of man’s relationship with the earth, his humble and harmonious dialogue with nature and the elements. Terre d'Hermès is the fragrance that connects man to his origins, to the sources of his creative power.

JARDIN SUR LE TOIT

“A festive garden, a garden that does as it pleases, bathed in light.” – Jean-Claude Ellena.

Un Jardin sur le Toit is a lively and piquant tale. This perfume tells the story of a secret garden, nestled in the heart of the city, in Paris. A hanging garden perched on the roof of the Hermès building at 24, faubourg Saint-Honoré. An apple tree, a pear tree, a magnolia in the Parisian air, wild herbs create this fragrance of light and pleasure, crunchy and cheerful.
