Caleche, Hermès' inaugural fragrance for women, was crafted by perfumer Guy Robert in 1961 and reinterpreted in 1992 as Caleche soie de parfum. This edition, whose name signifies the iconic horse-drawn carriages of Hermès, melds aldehyde with opulent jasmine and generous rose to create a floral scent with aldehyde aromas.
