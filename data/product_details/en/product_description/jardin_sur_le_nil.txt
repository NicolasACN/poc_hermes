Created in 2005, Un Jardin sur le Nil eau de toilette is an olfactory journey to the garden islands of Aswan, Egypt. This fragrance by Jean-Claude Ellena encapsulates the essence of the Nile's life-giving and generous nature. It features a green and woody scent, blending tangy green mango with delicate lotus flowers and elegant sycamore.
