Terre d'Hermès Parfum is a narrative of man's profound connection to the earth, articulated through a dialogue with nature and the elements. Launched by Jean-Claude Ellena in 2009, this fragrance intensifies the original Terre d'Hermès with a richer, deeper composition. It harmoniously blends the warmth of cedar, the brightness of grapefruit, and the unique radiance of shiso, creating a woody and enveloping scent.
