Voyage d'Herm√®s Parfum, crafted by Jean-Claude Ellena in 2011, is a powerful reinterpretation of its original fragrance. It moves beyond mere concentration, focusing on the depth of sensory experiences and a pronounced sillage. The scent is characterized by a woody and amber foundation, featuring invigorating juniper berry and a sweet, milky sandalwood.
