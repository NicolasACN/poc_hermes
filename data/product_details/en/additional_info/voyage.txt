Jean-Claude Ellena's quote on the creation process emphasizes the fragrance's intensity and trail. The bottle is designed to be sustainable, offering a 125 ml refill option. Hermès' historical connection to travel since 1837, initiated by Thierry Hermès with his harness and saddlery business, continues to inspire its products.
