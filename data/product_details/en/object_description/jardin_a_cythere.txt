The eau de toilette is encased in a bottle designed by Fred Rawyler, drawing inspiration from historical horse-drawn carriage lanterns. Its luminous yellow glass mirrors the sunny essence of the perfume. The accompanying box, illustrated by artist Elias Kafouros, depicts the vibrant Greek landscape with golden grasses, green olive trees, pink pistachios, and the distant blue sea.
