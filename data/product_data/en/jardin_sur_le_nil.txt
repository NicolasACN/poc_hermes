CREATION
Created in 2005, Un Jardin sur le Nil eau de toilette evokes an olfactory journey to the garden islands in Aswan, Egypt. In this composition, perfumer Jean-Claude Ellena tells of this river synonymous with life and generosity.

OLFACTORY NOTES

Green and woody, Un Jardin sur le Nil eau de toilette combines tangy green mango with delicate lotus and elegant sycamore.

THE OBJECT
Designed by Fred Rawyler, the bottle is inspired by the lines of horse-drawn carriage lanterns. Its glass is in a delicate green gradient, evoking the banks of the Nile. The box is illustrated with a lotus flower by artist Veronique de Mareuil.

THE PARFUMS-JARDINS COLLECTION
The Parfums-Jardins collection brings together the soul of a place, the perfumer's inspiration and the theme chosen by Herm√®s each year to nourish its creativity. They are olfactory strolls to share for every moment, to indulge every desire for freshness, reverie or escape.
