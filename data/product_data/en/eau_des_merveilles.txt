THE CREATION
Created by perfumers Ralf Schwieger and Nathalie Feisthauer, Eau des Merveilles eau de toilette showcases the wonders of Hermès. A world where the extraordinary is revealed with a shower of stars in broad daylight.

OLFACTORY NOTES
The woody and amber eau de toilette blends enveloping benzoin, spicy elemi and sparkling bigarade orange.

BOTTLE
Designed by Serge Mansau, the star-spangled magnifying-glass bottle twinkles with an orange light that shifts from intense to ethereal. The top of the spray is engraved with the House's Clou de Selle seal.

THE EAU DES MERVEILLES CONSTELLATION
This first opus of the Hermès Merveilles collection invites you to discover a world of enchantment with your feet on the ground and head in the stars. An olfactory constellation revealing the house's poetic view of the world.
