CREATION
Created by perfumer Guy Robert in 1961, Hermès' first fragrance for women, Caleche, was reinterpreted in 1992 as Caleche soie de parfum, the name of which refers to the horse-drawn carriages that are emblematic of the House and its silk metier.

OLFACTORY NOTES
Floral with aldehyde aromas, Caleche Soie de Parfum combines the refined notes of aldehyde with opulent jasmine and generous rose.

THE OBJECT
The bottle, inspired by the lanterns of horse-drawn carriages, has a black cap reminiscent of a riding hat. The back label is illustrated with a design by Philippe Dumas, indicating that it belongs to the Parfums-Fondateurs collection.

THE PARFUMS-FONDATEURS COLLECTION
The Parfums-Fondateurs collection draws inspiration from the House's heritage. Each creation encapsulates Hermès' imaginary world in a name, a fragrance and a color. Over the years, Hermès has pioneered a bold style of perfumery, resulting from encounters with exceptional perfumers.
