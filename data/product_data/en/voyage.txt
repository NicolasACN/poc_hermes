CREATION
In 2011, Jean-Claude Ellena created Voyage d'Hermès Parfum, an intense and generous reinterpretation of the original fragrance. "I moved away from the idea of 'concentrating' the formula to focus on the intensity of perceptions and the magnitude of the fragrance trail."

OLFACTORY NOTES
With a woody and amber character, Voyage d'Hermès Parfum reveals invigorating juniper berry blended with sweet and milky sandalwood.

THE OBJECT
Designer Philippe Mouquet created a unique object inspired by a pocket magnifying glass found by chance. The black glass bottle is encased in a silver-colored stirrup and decorated with the emblematic Clou de Selle.

ETHICS
The bottle can be replenished using the 125 ml Voyage d'Hermès Parfum refill. A responsible gesture, integral to an object created to last.

THE HERMÈS DETAIL
Hermès has been an artisan of movement and a valued companion for travelers ever since Thierry Hermès founded a harness and saddlery business in Paris in 1837. This theme underpins the House's creativity and inspires its culture.
