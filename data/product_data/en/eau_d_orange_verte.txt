CREATION
The very first Hermès cologne was created by Françoise Caron in 1979. It was initially called Eau de cologne Hermès, before being renamed Eau d'orange verte in 1997. Now iconic, it stands out for its vivid green freshness.

OLFACTORY NOTES
The Eau d'orange verte cologne combines vibrant orange with fresh mint and woody notes of moss.

THE OBJECT
The iconic lantern bottle is adorned with a deep green. On the orange box, a vividly contrasting band recalls the color of the bottle.

THE HERMÈS COLOGNES COLLECTION
The Hermès Colognes collection offers a playground that is as infinite as it is masterly for exploring the sensory nature of materials. It brings immediate and abundant pleasure that unifies beyond genres, fashions, ages or seasons.
